# GBE_vertex_model_sdk
Vertex model of germ band extension, including modelling of sidekick mutant. The code has been written using the open-source Chaste framework (http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/).

The model was used to generate simulations of wild-type and sidekick mutant tissues undergoing convergent extension. The simluations used were published here (..) and can be accessed in `test/TestSimulationsForSdkPaper.hpp`. The file contains test for three models that were run in the paper and can be run by following the Chaste doumentation on running tests (https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/trac/wiki/ChasteGuides/CmakeFirstRun).
